Hey guys this is a api i developed for a flutter Notes app as backend

- Let's go ðŸ”¥
- I've used Flask for building it..
- Make calls to api with https://flask1api.herokuapp.com/
- use /create and create a user with name and password --> https://flask1api.herokuapp.com/create?name=Name&pass=123456
- use /login and login user to get all information --> https://flask1api.herokuapp.com/login?name=Name&pass=123456
- use /add to add note for a specific user -->https://flask1api.herokuapp.com/add?note=buy%20vegetables&name=Name
- use /notes to get all the notes for a user --> https://flask1api.herokuapp.com/notes?name=Saffron
